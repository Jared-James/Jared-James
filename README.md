I build and manage full scale software solutions.

Believer of the Craftsman Philosophy & really into productivity.

I believe in always striving to write architectural well designed code, alongside providing great documentation.

I work hard to bridge the gap between software engineer and client, creating a holistic understanding of the projects goals & outcomes, to aid in making the best decisions possible.
