### Hi there, I'm Jared

Full Stack JavaScript & React Developer

I'm a believer of the craftsman philosophy - I had found this term while reading a book given to me by a friend. I had already started my journey into software development, I was finding it a good challenge, as well as finding it incredibly rewarding. The concept dawned on me, I wanted to be good, not just good, but great. The feeling of working towards mastery is unparalleled to any other internal feeling I’ve sought after.

I'm also really into productivity - seeing not how much I can get done in a day but seeing what the value of what I can get done in a day is. I'll write down where I think I lose time, where I spend too much time & try and craft a good balance, honestly, I really enjoy this.

I also play golf, that's like my ultimate de-stress. It's also something you can get better at by practicing & the sport does not play favourites, it's a direct correlation between good mental and physical capabilities that can both be worked on! - seems to be a trend here, how trendy.

Most of all, I want to connect with people who want to share their journey, whether that be at the start or the end - you can learn so much from what has already come and what is to be - if you have the right mind set. So honestly, feel free to contact me – ask me any questions; it’s a goal of mine to be more outgoing!

My Stack consits of
 JavaScript | React | Gatsby | nextjs | nestjs | Typescript | node/Express | Jest | Mongodb | Sass/scss/RFC/modules | redux | hooks/context & more... honestly it changes everyday..
