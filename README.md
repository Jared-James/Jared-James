I'm a believer of the craftsman philosophy - I had found this term while reading a book given to me by a friend. I had already started my journey into software development, I was finding it a good challenge, as well as finding it incredibly rewarding. The concept dawned on me, I wanted to be good, not just good, but great. The feeling of working towards mastery is unparalleled to any other internal feeling Iâ€™ve sought after.

I'm also really into productivity - seeing not how much I can get done in a day but seeing what the value of what I can get done in a day is. I'll write down where I think I lose time, where I spend too much time & try and craft a good balance, honestly, I really enjoy this.

I also play golf, that's like my ultimate de-stress. It's also something you can get better at by practicing & the sport does not play favourites, it's a direct correlation between good mental and physical capabilities that can both be worked on! - seems to be a trend here, how trendy.



My Stack consits of
 JavaScript | React | Gatsby | nextjs | nestjs | Typescript | node/Express/nest | Jest | Mongodb | Sass/scss/RFC/modules | redux | hooks/context 

I've also started to learn Solidity
